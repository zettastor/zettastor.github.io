## Submit Your Code
After finishing the development of your code, you should submit a pull request to `1.0-OS` branch and fill out a pull request template. 

An automated code style check has been added in the project compilation process. Please check the compilation result before submitting the code to ensure that there are no code style errors. While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Coding standard
Source code should be viewed and edited with your editor set to use two spaces per tab, with one tab used per indentation level. Spaces are used for other alignment within a line.

Most parts of the code follow [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html); some parts of the code follow [Oracle's Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html) -- mostly depending on who wrote the original version. Above all else, **be consistent with what you modify, and keep whitespace changes to a minimum when modifying existing source.** For new code, use Google Java Style.
